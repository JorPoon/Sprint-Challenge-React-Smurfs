1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

   Server Side Routing is when you request the data for a page, the server will only send out the necessary data to render out that one page. It allows for better search engine optimization but it could take longer depending on the size of the data. Every click into a new page will result in a new page reload. Client side routing is when the web pages are handled through javascript that allows different route to be rendered out depending on the conditions laid out by javascript. It is generally faster and smoother. It does not need to refresh a brand new page per click but could result in less search engine optimization. Also the initial download could take longer.
